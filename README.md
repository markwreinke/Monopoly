# Monopoly
 This is project from CSIS 2610: Programming and Problem Solving, a beginner computer science class taken in the Spring of 2018. 
 
 There are a number of bugs within the game that I wasn't able to fix before turning in the project, but a good amount of the functionality works as it should.
